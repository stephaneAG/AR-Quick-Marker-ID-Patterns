# AR-Quick-Marker-ID-Patterns
Quick helper lib to generate AR Markers ID Patterns from 0 to 99 directly on a &lt;canvas> without needing images

Interested ? See how I got those .. ;p

.. in other words, <canvas> back & forth ( .. )

ps: if someone is kind enough to provide me the corresponding Hamming code, I'd be happy to implement it as well for HTML5 canvas ( so long .swf utility .. )
